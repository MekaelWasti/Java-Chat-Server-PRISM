Java multithreaded server program made to manage multiple PRISM chat application clients, connecting from any connection on the internet.

or over the internet (by port forwarding public IP of machine running the server and changing the client to the public IP of that machine)

**The server is currently running on an EC2 (Not stable) instance on AWS. You can connect to this server with a socket connection using the public IP: 34.234.80.124 on port 63030.**
